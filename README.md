BOSS UPDATE

Typically in weapon progression after the pistol you'd get the machine gun, but I instead opted to give the player a shotgun.

It's earned by killing the new boss enemy distinguished by its purple sheen, stouter shape, and aggressive honing in on the player as it spews a bullet storm once it gets close.

Should the player manage to kill the beefy brute, they're rewarded with the same triple-shot gun that the defeated enemy had been using. 

I haven't been able to figure how to transition the player to the bossfight after finishing stage one, so it'd need to be opened manually in the scene folder.
